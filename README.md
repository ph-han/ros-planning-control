# 🚗 MORAI Planning & Control
> Vehicle local path planning and control

---

## Introduction

This project was developed for the **KATRI Creative Mobility Competition (Simulation Division)** organized by the Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT).  
It provides an autonomous driving `Planning and Control Stack` designed for the `MORAI Simulator` based on `ROS1`.  
The stack implements **Path Planning** using `Frenet-frame optimal trajectories`   
and **vehicle control** through `Pure Pursuit` and `PID-based longitudinal control`.
